## Visual Studio Requirements

### Visual Studio for PC

This solution requires Visual Studio for PC Version 15.3 or later.
Earlier versions of VS don't support Azure Functions.

### 1. Create Azure Function App

1. In the Azure portal, click on New -> Enter `Function App` into the Search Bar -> Selected `Function App` from the search results -> Click Create
2. Name the Function App
3. Select Consumption for the Hosting Plan
4. Select the your Resource Group
5. Select the Location closest to you
6. Click Create


### 2. Install Visual Studio Azure Functions Extension

1. Open using Visual Studio for PC (Version 15.3 or later)

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13558917/29254393-8a1b69e8-8049-11e7-8426-5e1d3ccb3193.png)

2. Ensure the following Extensions are installed
    - Visual Studio 2017 Tools for Azure Functions
    - Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools

### 3. Download the source from this Github code repository

1. Download the code from this Github code repository

2. Open the project on Visual Studio

4. Open the file Constants in the folder Constants - you'll need to fill in the details here from various Azure services; we'll go step-by-step through these including 1) Azure Blob Storage, 2) Azure Cosmos DB, 3) Azure AD Application registration,  4) Azure Media Services, and 5) a URL for a Azure WebHook associated with your Azure Media Services.

### 4. Create an Azure Blob Storage instance

1) Create an Azure Blob Storage instance in the Azure portal

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/31473265-35c4b40c-aea8-11e7-89ec-4903c214a0aa.png)
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/31473163-9f245156-aea7-11e7-9042-19248f5be84d.png)

2) Give it a unique name (it will only lowercase letter and numbers)

3) Once you've created the account take note of the account keys.  Look on the left menu bar for Settings > Access Keys.  Make a note of the KEY and CONNECTION STRING for either key1 or key2

### 5. Create an Azure Cosmos DB instance

1) Create an Azure Cosmos DB instance in the Azure Portal. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/31473020-ebbabec0-aea6-11e7-8d4b-2108a99865c6.png)

2) When entering your information, make sure you select **SQL (DocumentDB)**

3) Navigate to your Cosmos DB instance after it has been created

4) Select **Data Explorer (Preview)** in the menu options

5) Click **New Collection** in the top left corner

6) Name the Database Id *Xamarin* for this example and name the Collection Id *XamCamAccount3*.  You can change these but you must make the corresponding changes in your code under XamCamFunctions > CosmosDB > CosmosDBService.cs in the DatabaseId and CollectionId fields.

7) You will now see that the left menu is populated with our new database and collection. Select **XamCamAccount3** or whatever you called your collection and click on **Documents** -- it's empty now but this is where you'll see the videos you've taken from your IoT Device.

8) Once you've created the account take note of the account keys.  Look on the left menu bar for Settings > Keys.  Make a note of the URI, PRIMARY KEY, and PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING

### 6. Register an application in Azure Active Directory

1) Click to your Azure Active Directory.  On the left menu panel click to Manage > App Registrations.  Then in the resulting panel click, on the upper-left, + New application registration

2) Enter in a name, select Native as the Application Type, and type in a Redirect URI

3) Once you've registered the app take note of the account keys.  On the overview panel look for the application ID - we'll call this the Client ID in our application.  Click on the Settings, and click on Keys.  Create a Key and take a note of it as it will be called Client Secret in our application.  

4)Also depending on how we choose to do our Authentication - we will need the Directory Id of our Azure Active Directory Account.  You can find this by clicking back into the general Azure Active Directory section within the Azure portal.  On the left menu bar to go Manage > Properties > DirectoryID.  Take note of the DirectoryID - this will be called tenantID in our application.

### 7. Create an Azure Media Services Instance

1) Create an Azure Media Services Instance in the Azure portal
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/31474064-5d163df0-aead-11e7-829d-4ceeb8c0164f.png)

2) Give it a unique name (it will only lowercase letter and numbers) and connect it with the Storage Account in step 4

3) Click down to Streaming endpoints > take note of the hostname (you'll need to reference this in the application and add a slash at the end of the URL)

4) Click into the streaming endpoint, to press Play.  Click Settings and click on Premium we've set our Streaming Units to 2 for up to 400Mbs egress.

### 8. Publish Function App to Azure

1.  Return to the final step in Section 3: Download the source from this Github code repository - fill in the constants as appropriate from the above steps.  Optionally, you can store these values as Key/Value pairs under your Function > Application settings preventing the need to check in sensitive values in your source control. 

2. For the Webhook constants, you'll need to check back into the Azure portal under your Function after you published your function. Once you complete the below steps, go to the Azure Portal and click on the function called "NewXamCamWebHookThree". 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/31475091-a793acea-aeb3-11e7-8d45-ea87425b0e63.png)

Notice on the upper-right you see </> Get function URL.  That URL will be represented in the Constants class in your code as WebHookEndpoint.  Also, the WebHookSigningKey will be the portion of that URL between the "code=" and the "&clientId=default"

3. In Visual Studio, right-click on XamCamFunctions and select Publish

4. Choose AzureFunctionApp -> Select Existing -> Publish

5. After you are logged in, you'll see the Function App you created earlier.  Select that Functions App App and click OK 

6. Visual Studio is now publishing the XamCamFunctions code to your Azure Functions App

# XamCam IoT Functions Readme

The Following will show you how to create an IoT Hub in Azure and create Azure functions to create/register/delete iot devices registrations from your Hub. 

The IOTManager project contains a DeviceManager class which communicates with our Azure IoT Hub. Through this class we can provision new IOT Devices and get their connectionstrings, which we then use (from the client side, or the IoT device) to interact with the "Device Twin" - a digital representation of the various states of the IoT Device. 

### Creating the IoT Hub in Azure
1. In the azure portal, navigate to New. Search for IoT Hub and click Create
2. Name your IoT Hub, fill out the resource group (either new or existing).
Leave all other fields untouched
3. Click Create

### Getting the HostName and ConnectionString for the IOTManager
The file Constants.cs in the IOTManager project contains a few properties that we need to get from our newly created IotHub.

1. Navigate to your ResourceGroup that contains the newly created IoT Hub, and click on the IoT Hub
2. Under "Overview" - copy and paste the value for "HostName" to the <HostName> property in Constants.cs

3. Under "Shared access policies" - click on "iothubowner" and copy the value of "Connection stringâ€”primary key" into the <ConnectionString> property in Constants.cs

### The Device Twin

***What is the device twin?***

Device twins are JSON documents that store device state information (metadata,configurations, and conditions). IoT Hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. 

For more information on device twins, visit this article on [understanding device twins.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins)

#### In the device explorer panel, add a device (provide a unique ID) and view it's twin:

### Azure Functions API Reference
There are 3 api endpoints defined within the functions project: 

**GET or POST: /api/AddDevice/id/{uniqueDeviceIdAsString}**

- Takes in a string parameter for the ID of the IoT device. This string has to be unique.

- If device doesn't exist it creates a new one, and returns the connection string to IoTHub. If it does exist it simply returns the connection string


**PUT or DELETE: /api/DeleteDevice/id/{DeviceId}**
 - This endpoint deletes the device specified by the id if it exists

**GET: /api/GetDevices/{Optional ID parameter}**

 - Returns a List of devices. 
 - If the deviceID parameter supplied - it returns that device
- If no parameter supplied - it returns ALL devices
